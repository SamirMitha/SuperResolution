There are multiple ways to run the code. Either the Colab notebooks or the source code can be used. The recommended method is the Colab notebook, as Google Colab will handle all pypi dependencies. Additional dependencies may be required when using the source code.

## Colab Instructions
**Method 1: Single Image Upscaling and Visualization**

To run single image upscaling using all of the methods use demo.ipynb

Steps:
1. Open demo.ipynb in Google Colab
2. Switch the Google Colab Runtime to GPU
3. Run the notebook block

To change the image that is evaluated on, change the folder in the .yml and .json files located in /options/test

**Method 2: Batch Image Upscaling**

To run image upscaling on the entire test set use test.ipynb

Steps:
1. Open test.ipynb in Google Colab
2. Switch Colab Runtime to GPU
3. Run the notebook blocks sequentially to ensure all dependencies are present

To change the test set that is evaluated on, change the folder in the .yml and .json files located in /options/test
